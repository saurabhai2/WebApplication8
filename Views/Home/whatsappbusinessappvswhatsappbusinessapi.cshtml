                            <p>
                                When WhatsApp introduced the WhatsApp Business app,
                                it came out as a great tool for small businesses to interact with customers.
                                However, Facebook soon realized that medium and large businesses had more
                                complex needs,so keeping their needs in mind, they opened up access to the WhatsApp
                                Business API.
                                &nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, you might wonder what the difference is between the app and the API.
                                Well, for those who aren't technically inclined, it can be a bit confusing. If
                                you’re struggling to
                                understand the differences between App and API, keep reading the blog to know the
                                right choice for your business solutions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The WhatsApp Business app is like a standalone application that anyone can easily
                                install
                                on their mobile phones. It is a free app basically made for small business owners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whatsapp comes out as a popular messaging app with 2 million users worldwide,
                                businesses starting using it to communicate with their customers,
                                but normal WhatsApp didn't have the right features.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the WhatsApp Business app, those problems were solved. Now, small business
                                owners can make detailed business profiles,
                                show their working hours, and display their products. They can even set up automatic
                                welcome and away messages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's a useful tool that helps small
                                businesses to communicate better with their customers and manage their business
                                interactions more efficiently.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                On the other hand, the WhatsApp Business API is more suited for medium and large
                                businesses. Since WhatsApp Business App’s
                                Capabilities were limited, whatsapp decided to introduce a new solution for growing
                                businesses called the WhatsApp Business API.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The WhatsApp Business API, Launched by Facebook in 2018, lets businesses send and
                                receive unlimited messages to people all around the world through WhatsApp.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By using this API, businesses can create better experiences for their customers on
                                WhatsApp and reach a wider audience.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's not a standalone app, but rather a set of tools and functions that developers
                                can integrate into their existing systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WhatsApp Business API gives developers the freedom to build tools that eliminate
                                these restrictions and even add new features. This flexibility allows businesses
                                to integrate various tools to make WhatsApp even more powerful and tailored to their
                                specific needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the API, you can send messages programmatically, set up chatbots, and manage a
                                large volume of customer conversations efficiently.

                                Before we go deeper into the topic, let me quickly explain the main differences
                                between the WhatsApp Business App and the WhatsApp Business API in simple words.
                            </p>

                                We'll compare WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business Platform (API) based on a
                                number of factors:
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Designed For</h3>

                            <p>
                                WhatsApp Business App is designed for small businesses and can handle only a few
                                customer conversations. It's easy to use and doesn't cost anything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the flip side, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) is
                                meant for bigger businesses with dedicated teams managing large customer
                                communications.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Broadcast Limitations</h3>

                            <p>
                                When sending broadcast messages, WhatsApp Business App can only send them to groups
                                of up to 256 people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) can send broadcasts to any number
                                of people depending upon your tier level. That is a different concept though.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, the reach of WhatsApp Business App broadcasts is limited to those who have
                                saved the business number in their contacts. But with WhatsApp Business Platform
                                (API), there are no such restrictions, and the messages can reach anyone.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Team Inbox</h3>

                            <p>
                                In WhatsApp Business App, it's not simple to share your inbox with team members. You
                                can try using WhatsApp Web, but it has some drawbacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if someone gets logged out, you need to help them log back in. Also,
                                you won't know who replied to a message, and it's challenging to see which
                                conversations have been handled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whereas, WhatsApp Business API software doesn't have any limits on team size, lets
                                you assign conversations, and helps you keep track of pending tasks. It makes
                                working together as a team easy and efficient.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Voice Calls</h3>

                            <p>
                                In WhatsApp Business App, you can make voice calls like you do in regular WhatsApp.

                                But, as of now, the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) doesn't support voice calls.
                                This means partner services cannot offer this feature.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, don't worry! You can still make voice calls using your phone's regular
                                phone services with the same WhatsApp Business number.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multi User Access</h3>

                            <p>
                                WhatsApp Business App can only be installed on one phone, but you can use WhatsApp
                                Web on up to 4 devices to access it. However, WhatsApp Web is not suitable for
                                multiple users, leading to some limitations:

                            </p>

                            <ul class="pb-4">
                                <li>1. You won't know who responded to a customer message..</li>
                                <li>
                                    2. When viewing conversations, you can't tell if someone else is already
                                    replying,
                                    causing confusion.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) works through a partner service
                                like Enchant, offering a more robust interface for team collaboration. With Enchant,
                                you get these benefits:

                            </p>


                            <ul class="pb-4">
                                <li> 1. Real-time visibility of team members typing or viewing a conversation.</li>
                                <li> 2. Ability to assign conversations to specific team members.</li>
                                <li>
                                    3. Collaboration through in-conversation private notes that customers can't
                                    see.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) can be used on an unlimited number of
                                devices, making it more flexible and convenient for teams.

                            </p>
                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Automated Chatbots</h3>



                            <p>
                                In WhatsApp Business App, you won't find any chatbot functionality or a way to
                                integrate them into your conversations.
                            </p>



                            <p>
                                But in WhatsApp Business Platform (API), you have the option to use chatbots, which
                                can be quite handy. These chatbots can help gather additional information from
                                customers and manage conversations, even when you're not available to respond.
                            </p>



                            <p>
                                In WhatsApp Business App, you can automate only greeting messages for new customers
                                and away messages when you're unavailable
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But with WhatsApp Business Platform (API), you can do so much more! It allows you to
                                automate various types of messages, like order notifications, shipping updates, drip
                                campaigns, and nurturing leads.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Verified Green Tick</h3>
                            <p>
                                Having a green tick on your WhatsApp business profile assures potential customers
                                that you are a verified business they can trust.

                                In WhatsApp Business App, there is no way to enable the green verification tick on
                                your profile.
