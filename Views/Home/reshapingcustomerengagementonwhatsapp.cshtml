                                The journey started when we realized that the existing customer engagement solutions
                                in the market were not up to the mark to deliver exceptional customer experience.
                            </p>

                                Soon we realized that WhatsApp, the popular app with a whopping 98% engagement rate,
                                had the perfect potential to bring our vision to life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We joined forces with WhatsApp as a trusted business solution provider and utilized
                                their official WhatsApp Business API to create our advanced platform.

                                singular focus on transforming customer support, but we soon realized that our
                                ambitions reached far beyond that realm.
